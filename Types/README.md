# ATN: Types

In ATN, a type is a set that integrates its elements (a.k.a. instances) into a named concept.

## Type Declaration

A type is declared as one or more words, each with its first letter capitalized, all joined without spaces between them:


```haskell
RationalNumber
```

As shown above, just the name of the type is suffcient to have it known in the current context. No definition is required.
