# Abstract Type Notation (ATN)

ATN is a notation to write specifications via the definition of types, constants and assertions.

It is not intended to write programs. On the contrary, it provides a declarative syntax, and supporting semantics, such as those found in type theory, lambda calculus and predicate logic.

It aims at keeping the specifications at a sufficiently abstract level, so that implementation-specific concerns do not obfuscate the clarity and the objectivity necessary in specifications.

## Types

In ATN, a type is a set that integrates its elements (a.k.a. instances) into a named concept.

## Constants

In ATN, a constant refers to a specific instance of a type. 

The same instance is always referred by the name of a constant throughout the context where such a constant is defined.
