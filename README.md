# Abstract Type Notation (ATN)

ATN is a notation to write specifications via the definition of types, constants and assertions.

It is not intended to write programs. On the contrary, it provides a declarative syntax, and supporting semantics, such as those found in type theory, lambda calculus and predicate logic.
